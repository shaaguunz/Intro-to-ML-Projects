## üìÇ Folder Structure
Each project is organized as follows:



## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Intro-to-ML-Projects.git
    cd Intro-to-ML-Projects
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Each project may have its own set of dependencies. For general packages, consider installing:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(You may need to create virtual environments for each project if dependencies differ.)*

3. **Open a notebook:**
   Each project‚Äôs notebook contains code and explanations. You can start with any project that interests you.

## üí° Project Highlights

Here‚Äôs a closer look at a few of the projects:

- **Boston Housing**: Learn to build a regression model for price prediction. Topics covered include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics.
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: A classification problem tackling the challenge of imbalanced datasets and using techniques like SMOTE.
- **Wine Quality Prediction**: A classification project that demonstrates feature selection, scaling, and evaluation with accuracy and F1-score.
- **Stock Market Analysis**: A time-series analysis using ARIMA and LSTM models to predict stock trends over time.

## üìä Data Sources

Most datasets are from popular open data sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), and public datasets.

## üìà Results

Results and key findings from each project are documented within the Jupyter notebooks.
